# B01 — First PDF Core Slice (IN PROGRESS)

## Delivered source
- Read-only inspection: actual PDF parsing, page count, page size, SHA-256, title/author, encryption/password gating, bounded text-layer sampling.
- Invalid/malformed PDF rejection with no writes to the input.
- Synthetic fixtures generated in memory using pypdf (no private PDF files committed).
- 5 automated tests for valid blank PDF, text layer, wrong/correct password, malformed input and sample-limit guard.
- pypdf pinned to 6.21.2 for CI, the published Oct 21 2026 security-release; host test environment used pypdf 5.9.0 pending CI on the pin.

## Known exclusions
Not yet implemented: rendering, thumbnails, editing, library/index, full-text search across documents, safe parser subprocess isolation, signatures/attachments introspection, billion-object malformed-document caps, genuine 1000+/5000-page performance, Android integration, Windows native UI. These remain F01/F08 TODO; do not mark PASS from the preflight-only spike.

## Tests
- Host synthetic suite: B00 8 + B01 5 = 13 PASS (Python with local pypdf 5.9.0). Pinned 6.21.2 GitHub CI evidence pending.
- No APK/EXE building, no OCR or user content processed.

## Next implementation
Implement page ranges, metadata browser, safe file IO, and parser-isolation limits; build valid corpus and benchmark; proceed to viewer adapter after ADR decision.
